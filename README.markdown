# Acronym Expander
I was tired of reading things online and seeing so many acronyms that I was
aware of. So, here we are with a Chrome Extension to expand those acronyms for you.

## Why?
Well, I thought it would be funny to see text change to _my_ definitions of
the acronyms. It's basically Mad Libs!

But also, I never wrote a Chrome Extension and I wanted to. And I don't write
Javascript, so any exercise to do so is okay by me. :)

## Dictionary Definitions
You can see the definitions of acronyms in [content.js](content.js).

## Current Sites That Are Supported
 - instagram.com
 - reddit.com
 - twitter.com

## Installation
You can read more from the Chrome Developer's [page](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted), but instructions are basically the following below.

 - clone this repo
 - In Chrome, navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
 - Enable `Developer mode`
 - Click `Load Unpacked` and select the directory where you cloned this repo
